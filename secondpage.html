  <h2>Internship Experience Description</h2>

  <h3>Chicago Bears <img src="bears.jpg"></h3>
  <p>Working in the Fan Strategy and Analytics team, I conducted custom research projects on gamedays to collect demographic and marketing information about attendees through questionnaires and interviews. This data was then synthesized for execs. I would generally arrive two to three hours before game time, surveying fans from various demographics.  Our focus was to capture who was actually in the stadium at any given time and what they were spending on.  This work will help the Bears segment their fans into very detailed groups and create tailored marketing strategies around these unique demographics</p>

  <h3>Major League Baseball <img src="mlb.jpg"></h3>
  <p> I worked with Labor Economics Team supporting league-wide initiatives including re-invigorating youth baseball, improving pace of game, optimizing the schedule, evaluating the Draft/CBA, and assessing competitive balance. Several of the pace of the game measures I recommended were implemented in the Arizona Fall League and Minor League Baseball. </p>

  <h3>Intersport</h3>
  <p> My fellow classmate and I delivered competitive analysis presentations in the areas of digital sports networks, sports trivia, and fantasy sports applications. We worked closely with the Media time to develop new products through consumer research, market testing, and survey analysis. In addition, we worked with Kellogg professors to develop a broader research thesis on the digital sports space in general</p>

  <h3>Chicago White Sox <img src="whitesox.jpg"></h3>
  <p> Working for the White Sox Analytics team, we analyzed sales data for White Sox / Chicago Sports Depot and provided insights into customer buying behavior and future product/bundling/promotion recommendations. The project first focused on the Sports Depot and assessing what products were selling well. We found that high margin products included female merchandise and game day gear. Furthermore, we analyzed what food products (beer, sandwiches,etc.) were selling at the ChiSox Bar and Grill. </p>
